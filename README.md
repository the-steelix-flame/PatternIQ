## About The Project

For most retail traders in India, the stock market feels complex and intimidating. They have creative trading ideas but no way to test them without learning to code. This turns trading into guesswork, leading to poor, emotion-driven decisions.

PatternIQ solves this by providing a suite of AI-native tools in a single, intuitive platform. Our mission is to democratize the tools of professional traders and make the market more accessible, educational, and engaging for everyone.

## Key Features

üèÜ **The Arena: A Gamified Learning Hub**
- **Personalized Daily Quizzes:** A new, AI-generated quiz is created every day based on recent market news. The difficulty (Levels 1-20) adapts to the user's skill, which is based on their Reputation Points (RP).
- **Live Leaderboard & Profiles:** Users compete for RP and can view each other's profiles and ranks, fostering a fun and competitive learning environment.

üß† **The Ultimate AI Backtesting Engine**
- **True No-Code:** Users describe complex strategies in plain English (e.g., "Buy on a resistance breakout if MACD is positive").
- **Three-Stage AI Workflow:** A unique system uses AI to first parse the user's intent, then dynamically generate the Python code for analysis, and finally provide a detailed performance review.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Results include interactive equity/drawdown charts, key metrics like Profit Factor, and a full AI-written report with actionable insights.

üìÖ **The Interactive Trader's Calendar**
- **AI-Powered Events:** The calendar is automatically populated with key market events (Domestic, Global, Corporate) generated by AI daily.

üîÆ **Visionary Features (Planned)**

2.  **Backend (FastAPI):** The Python backend serves as the brain, handling all business logic and orchestrating calls to the Google Gemini API.
3.  **AI (Google Gemini):** Used for specialized tasks: parsing natural language, generating Python code, creating quiz questions, and writing analytical reports.
4.  **Database (Firebase Firestore):** A real-time NoSQL database stores all user profiles, private calendar notes, and cached AI-generated content.

---

## Technology Stack

- **AI/ML:** Python, Google Gemini API, Pandas, NumPy, Pandas-TA.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic.
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Material-UI (MUI), MUI X Charts, Axios, Vite.
- **Database & Auth:** Google Firebase (Firestore), Google OAuth 2.0.

Step 3: The Complete GitHub Upload Commands
Now that your project has the two necessary files (.gitignore and README.md), you are ready to upload.

Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub.com, click "New repository".

Give it a name (e.g., PatternIQ-Hackathon).

Make sure it is Public.

Do NOT initialize it with a README or .gitignore.

Click "Create repository" and copy the HTTPS URL.

Run These Commands in Your Terminal:

Open your terminal and navigate to your main patterniq project folder.

Run these commands one by one, exactly as written.

# Command 1: Initialize Git
# This turns on Git tracking for your project.
git init

# Command 2: Add All Files
# This prepares all your code for upload, automatically ignoring the secret files.
git add .

# Command 3: Create a "Snapshot" (Commit)
# This saves the current state of your project.
git commit -m "Initial commit: Build complete prototype of PatternIQ platform"

# Command 4: Set the Main Branch Name
git branch -M main

# Command 5: Connect to GitHub
# IMPORTANT: Replace the URL with the one you copied from your GitHub repo.
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/PatternIQ-Hackathon.git

# Command 6: Upload Your Code
# This is the final step that sends everything to GitHub.
git push -u origin main
